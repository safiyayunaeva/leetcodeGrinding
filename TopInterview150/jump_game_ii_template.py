	Jump Game II
	You are given a 0-indexed array of integers nums of length n. You are initially positioned at nums[0].
	Each element nums[i] represents the maximum length of a forward jump from index i. In other words, if you are at nums[i], you can jump to any nums[i + j] where:
	
	0 <= j <= nums[i] and
	i + j < n
	
	Return the minimum number of jumps to reach nums[n - 1]. The test cases are generated such that you can reach nums[n - 1].
	
	Constraints:
	
	1 <= nums.length <= 104
	0 <= nums[i] <= 1000
	It's guaranteed that you can reach nums[n - 1].

	Explanation:The minimum number of jumps to reach the last index is 2. Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.
